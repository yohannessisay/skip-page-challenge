## 🏆 Performance & Quality

### Lighthouse Scores

This application achieves excellent web standards compliance:

- **Accessibility**: 100/100 ✅
- **Best Practices**: 100/100 ✅
- **SEO**: 100/100 ✅
- **Performance**: 95+/100 ⚡

#### Performance Notes

The performance score is not 100% due to optimization opportunities that are typically handled at the infrastructure level:

- **Enable text compression**: Potential savings of 2,788 KiB - resolved by configuring gzip/brotli compression in nginx/server
- **Minify JavaScript**: Handled by production build tools and CDN optimization

These optimizations are outside the scope of frontend development and would be addressed through proper server configuration and deployment pipeline setup.
